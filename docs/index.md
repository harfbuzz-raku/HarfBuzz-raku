Bindings to the HarfBuzz text shaping library.

Minimum supported HarfBuzz version is v2.6.4 - See [Installation](#installation)

Note: If the HarfBuzz::Subset module is being installed, then the minimum HarfBuzz
library version is v3.0.0+.

Name
----

HarfBuzz - Use HarfBuzz for text shaping and font manipulation.

Synopsis
--------

```
use HarfBuzz::Font;
use HarfBuzz::Buffer;
use HarfBuzz::Shaper;
use HarfBuzz::Feature;
use HarfBuzz::Glyph;
my HarfBuzz::Feature() @features = <smcp -kern -liga>; # enable small-caps, disable kerning and ligatures
my $file = 't/fonts/NimbusRoman-Regular.otf';
my HarfBuzz::Font $font .= new :$file, :size(36), :@features;
my HarfBuzz::Buffer $buf .= new :text<Hello!>;
my HarfBuzz::Shaper $shaper .= new: :$font :$buf;
for $shaper.shape -> HarfBuzz::Glyph $glyph { ... }
my Hash @info = $shaper.ast;
```

Description
----------

HarfBuzz is a Raku module that provides access to a small subset of the native HarfBuzz library. 

The subset is suitable for typesetting programs, whether they need to do basic glyph selection and layout, or deal with complex languages like Devanagari, Hebrew or Arabic.

Following the above example, the returned info is an array of hashes, one element for each glyph to be typeset. The hash contains the following items:

```
ax:   horizontal advance
ay:   vertical advance
dx:   horizontal offset
dy:   vertical offset
c:    input character position
g:    glyph index in font (CId)
name: glyph name
```

Note that the number of glyphs does not necessarily match the number of input characters!
